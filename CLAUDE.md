# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific guidance for Claude Code working in this repo
(`tb-multi-agent` — the Threadbase Temporal worker).

## Release notes

Milestone-level release notes live in `docs/release-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<milestone>.md`. They are separate from any auto-generated CHANGELOG and capture the human story of what shipped, why it matters, and what's deferred.

When a milestone is ready to merge, invoke the project-local `write-release-notes` skill (at `.claude/skills/write-release-notes/`) to draft them. Add the `milestone` label to the merge PR — a GitHub Action will post a reminder if release notes are not present.

## Merging PRs — Rebase + Squash, Linear History

Keep `main` a straight line — one commit per PR, no merge commits. Every PR follows the same two operations, in this order:

1. **Rebase onto latest `main`** to sync before merging. `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`, resolve conflicts preserving the PR's intent, then `git push --force-with-lease` (never plain `--force`, never force-push `main`). This guarantees no merge commit sneaks in.
2. **Squash-merge** the rebased PR: `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`. The squash title must be conventional-commit compliant and carry no AI attribution.

Rules:

- **One PR at a time.** Never sync/merge PRs in parallel — rebase one, wait for its CI to go green, squash-merge it, then move to the next. A just-merged PR advances `main`, so the next PR is usually behind and must be rebased again.
- **Dependency order first.** If PR B is stacked on PR A (GitHub shows A's branch as B's base), merge A before B and rebase B onto the updated `main` afterward.
- **CI gate.** Only squash-merge when required checks are green. If CI is red on a flaky/infra failure, re-run it **once**; if the re-run still fails, stop and report — do not merge red.
- **Stuck cap.** If any single step hangs for more than ~3–4 minutes (CI not progressing, a rebase that won't resolve cleanly), stop and report rather than waiting indefinitely.
